  Web Appilication for creating platform for collage events, club ,activities etc
  
  1.Using express and node js please try to build a proper backend which can handle get and post requests using (aws lambda or just your local machine) i was unsuccesfull 
    because i didnt know the process to integrate react and node.js please help me
  
  2.The Main issue with the project is image data delivery from database(backend) to front end react js and uploading images from front end to datatbse One solution i         found on cloudinary was we should manually upload our images then it will create a public url for the image but we need something like image hosting service where we
    can have network/club/image_id/23 
    
  3.integrating react and node is the main issue as it requires two seperate node servers can any one provide good solution for it
